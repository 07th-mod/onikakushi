# PS3 Voice and Graphics Patch
#### For Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni - Chapter 1 Onikakushi

> This repository **only** hosts the script files and a few voice files needed to fix bugs, check our [wiki](https://07th-mod.com/wiki/Higurashi/Higurashi-Getting-started) for instructions on how to install the patch!

This patch aims to combine the efforts of the ps3 voice patch and the ps3 sprites/background patch, and fill in missing voice files not covered by the original voice patch.

The master file will always have the latest files, regardless of the current release being outdated or not.
