            ## Install/Update Instructions

            We **HIGHLY** recommend using [our installer](https://github.com/07th-mod/python-patcher/releases/latest) to install the mod automatically, instead of the files on this page.

            ----

            **DO NOT USE THE FILES BELOW UNLESS YOU REALLY WANT TO INSTALL MANUALLY, AND HAVE READ THE MANUAL INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS**

            **THIS PAGE ONLY CONTAINS ONE PART OF THE PATCH. YOU NEED OTHER FILES FOR THE MOD TO WORK**

            If you really want to install manually, follow the [manual install instructions](https://07th-mod.com/wiki/Higurashi/Manual-Installation/).
